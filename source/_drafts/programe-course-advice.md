These quotes are from students who were nearing the end of their first programming course. They were asked to provide advice to future students (such as you!) about how to be successful in this course.

Their advice falls into three categories: general advice, programming-specific advice, and attitudinal advice. It is important for beginning programming students (like you!) to recognize all three of these areas as part of good practices that, when employed regularly and thoughtfully, can contribute to success in computing classes. Do your practice, habits, and behaviors regarding your programming course include aspects from all three of these categories? If not, these students would say it should.

THese sutdents are similar to you. They may not have had any programming experience before this course. They might feel that everyone else knows more than they do. They might have struggled with and been frustrated by the course material. Their advice is based on this relevant experience.

## General Advice

*最大化利用课堂：*“按时上课，因为这不是一个简单的课程，并且需要许多耐心。有问题就问。专心听课。如果你对讲课的内容有任何一点不理解，立刻去问老师，不要犹豫。”

“我认为最重要的事就是不懂就问。在高中的时候我不怎么需要帮助因为高中课程都不难，并且我感觉如果我求助别人是因为我不聪明。”

“首先，要跟上课程内容，如果你在编程上落后了，就很难再追上。并且如果你落后了，你无法无视那些落后的内容，因为整个课程都是一个个积累起来的，你要知道之前的内容才能继续前进。其次，课堂上你不能光听不做。”

*从错误中学习：*“理解的关键是利用每一个错误做垫脚石，每一个错误都要学习。弄清楚**为什么**会出错能让你理解原因。”

“每一个人都会犯错，要从错误中学习。”

*向其他人学习：*“和别人一起做也很有帮助，因为三人行必有我师。”

“利用你教授的工作时间问问题并寻求帮助是很重要的。”

## Programming Specific Advice


*实践中学习：*“解决一个问题后，问自己如何修改程序并且如何玩转这个程序。实践是最好的学习方式。”

“自己动手实验。通过实践你能发现并记住如何该如何写代码。”

“设计错误看看输出。”

“如果一个程序跑不起来就研究一下。使用调试器。”

“我的建议是注意细节并且学习例子。确保自己理解为什么每个符号为什么在这（例如 `[]`，分号，`<>`）。你可以尝试记住每个错误消息的含义，这样下次你看到同样的错误就知道自己做错了什么。”

## Attitudinal Advice

*It's OK, you are just a beginner:* Everyone is at different levels, there are bound to be other people that know less or the same as you. (bound to be: **肯定**有人和你一样的水平或者更少)
